# Greenhouse-monitoring-System

We have developed a context aware system which records soil moisture, pH , 

humidity, Air quality, Temperature ,light level and makes adaptive measures based on the situation.

We also have handling measure in case of hardware/software failure.

This System helps maintain an environment which helps growth of plants in the Greenhouse.
